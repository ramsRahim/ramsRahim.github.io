                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>My academic journey at Binghamton University has been a transformative exploration in deep learning
                    and IoT. As I delved into this rapidly progressing field, I identified a burgeoning challenge: the increasing
                    security risks inherent in deep learning technologies. This realization spurred me to investigate these vulnerabilities,
                    leading to a collaborative research effort. Our findings were encapsulated in the paper “Secure
                    Source Free Domain Adaptation,” which I had the honor of co-authoring. This paper was subsequently
                    presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), a highly respected conference in our
                    field.</p>

                <p>In addition to this research, my Master’s thesis is centered around the development of real-time data
                    analytics, where I have incorporated Real Time Object Detection using raspberry pi. The system is being used to detect spotted lantern fly in the wild.
                    Alongside these endeavors, I took the opportunity to further refine my smart stick project, initially developed during my undergraduate studies. For the
                    Introduction to IoT course, I evolved the project, now named "Third Eye," by integrating continuous connectivity using LoRa technology.</p>

                        Detecting invasive species like the Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) in remote and hard-to-reach places such as tree
                        branches or tall building walls is labor-intensive and leads to significant crop
                        losses. To tackle this, we developed a new system, a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
                        architecture that incorporates MobileNet V3, optimized for low-power devices and
                        trained on a dedicated SLF dataset. Deployed on a Raspberry Pi Model B with a
                        LoRa module, our system is energy-efficient and operates effectively on edge devices
                        with limited computational resources through quantization, achieving high accuracy
                        and low latency for detection. Our results demonstrate that our system covers a
                        larger area and consumes significantly less power than other network technologies
                        such as WiFi and Bluetooth, making it a superior solution for managing invasive
                        species in expansive, resource-limited environments

                        We are developing a real-time object detection system that can adapt to changes in the environment. We are using optical flow to detect changes in the environment, and then using this information to adapt the object detection model to the new environment.

                        In this research, the primary objective is to investigate the effect of elimination of non linear activation in the
                        DNN in terms of robustness. We have shown that the linear neural network is vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

                        training by the victim (target do-main owner). We also built a defense method for the attack as well.

                        We then ran the pipeline on the 3D point cloud of the face and got the local features.
